# User Registration & Authorization Automation Berlin Travel Agency

This repository contains a comprehensive suite of automated tests for user registration and login functionality. Built with **Selenium WebDriver** and **TestNG**, this project automates the testing of various input field validations, error handling, and password visibility toggling in the user registration and login forms.

## üöÄ Features

### User Registration Tests
- **Empty Field Validation**: Ensures the system properly handles empty fields during registration (first name, last name, password).
- **Invalid Field Handling**: Verifies the application throws errors when invalid data is entered (e.g., invalid email format, short passwords).
- **Duplicate Email Handling**: Tests how the system responds when a registered email is reused during registration.

### User Authorization Tests
- **Login Functionality**: Validates that users can successfully log in with correct credentials.
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Tests the functionality of the password visibility toggle icon and ensures password visibility can be toggled correctly.
- **Email Validation**: Verifies that invalid emails are rejected during the login process.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `com.TestBase.java`: Base class that handles the setup and teardown for the WebDriver, as well as common utilities for all tests.
- `UserAuthorizationTests/`: Tests for user login functionality, including visibility toggling for the password field.
- `RegistrationTests/`: Tests for validating user registration fields and handling various error scenarios.

## üì¶ Requirements

To run this project, you‚Äôll need the following:
- **Java** (18 or higher)
- **Gradle** (for managing dependencies and building the project)
- **Selenium WebDriver**
- **TestNG** (for running the tests)
- **ChromeDriver** (ensure it matches your installed Chrome version)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cohort47/TeamProject-QA.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   gradle clean build
   ```

3**Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   gradle test
   ```

   - Alternatively, tests can be run using **TestNG** from an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

## üìù Test Reports

After running the tests, you can find the detailed test results in the `build/reports/tests/test` directory. Test logs and reports are available under the `build/test-results` folder.

## ‚ö° Test Cases

### **UserRegistrationTests**

- **testEmptyFirstName**: Tests the case when the first name field is empty.
- **testEmptyLastName**: Tests the case when the last name field is empty.
- **testInvalidEmail**: Ensures that an invalid email address is correctly rejected during registration.
- **testInvalidPassword**: Verifies that weak passwords (less than 8 characters or without special characters) are rejected.
- **testDuplicateEmail**: Checks if the system catches an already registered email during the registration process.

### **UserAuthorizationTests**

- **testLogin**: Verifies that a user can log in using valid credentials.
- **testPasswordVisibilityToggle**: Ensures that clicking the eye icon reveals the password and clicking it again hides it.
- **testInvalidEmailLogin**: Tests how the system reacts when an invalid email is used for login.
- **testInvalidPasswordLogin**: Tests the behavior when an incorrect password is provided.
